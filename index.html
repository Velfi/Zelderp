			<h1>What's all this about then?</h1>
			<p>I bought this domain on a whim. Something about purchasing virtual real estate just feels good to me. I also wanted a domain where I could be a little less serious (my other website, <a href="http://www.ifitisina.com">ifitisina.com</a>, is meant to be my professional portfolio.)</p>
			<p>Anyways, we're both here now, so where does that leave us?</p>
